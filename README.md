Data weird stuff:
- Layla is going to London in July 2026
- Vikram has 3 cars

- Some people have future dates (it's fake data probably)
Hi team! 

Here's my working question-answering API 

GitHub: https://github.com/Punitha-P/my-cute-api
Live URL: https://my-cute-api.up.railway.app

Demo queries:
1. Layla's trip: https://my-cute-api.up.railway.app/ask?question=When%20is%20Layla%20Kawaguchi%20going%20to%20London
2. Vikram's cars: https://my-cute-api.up.railway.app/ask?question=How%20many%20cars%20does%20Vikram%20Desai%20have
3. Amira's restaurant: https://my-cute-api.up.railway.app/ask?question=What%20is%20Amira%20favorite%20restaurant

It has backup data so works even if API is down!
Bonus: Rule-based + fallback data + deployed in 30s

Thank you! 
Punitha
